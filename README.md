# jira-docker

Welcome to JIRA docker image. What is this? This is simply something that have been missing over the whole Internet. Some fully automated one click JIRA installation. I tried to use Puppet, but official JIRA Puppet Forge stuff was obsolete.

You can get clean JIRA installation this way:

docker run -it -p 8080:8080  ivantichy/jira
